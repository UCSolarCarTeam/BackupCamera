= Steps to Setup Proper Camera Streaming Environment on a Fresh SD Card 

. Run MainInstaller.sh as root (found in the installer directory).
+
. Run AutobootSetup.sh as root (found in the installer directory).
+
. Run "tvservice -d edid" from the terminal followed by "edidparser edid".
+
. Find the preferred screen resolution / refresh rate from the list,
look for HDMI:EDID DMT or CEA mode.
+
. Open /boot/config.txt as root. Uncomment out hdmi_group and hdmi_mode.
   If the reolution was CEA, write a 1 for group, if it was DMT write 2
   Write the number in brackets after the mode for hdmi_mode.
+
i.e) if you see:
+
`HDMI:EDID best score mode is now DMT (27) 1280x800p @ 60 Hz with pixel clock 71 MHz (score 5184320)`
+
Then write 2 for hdmi_group and 27 for mode for a result of:
[source,shell]
# uncomment to force a specific HDMI mode (this will force VGA) 
hdmi_group=2 
hdmi_mode=27 
. Save the file and reboot the pi.
 
= Compiling and Running the Program
1. After cloning the repository, `cd` into the "_Installer_" file
2. Run the command `sudo ./MainInstaller.sh`
3. Next run the command `make` to create generate the executable for the BackupCamera code
4. The program should now run with `./BackupCamera`
   * The program currently takes 6 command line arguments
      ** 2 for window position (x, y), 2 for window size (x, y) and 2 for camera resolution
   * If the window is black refer to the _setting up a webcam in the vm_ instructions below

      ** Example file path may be: `cd c:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox`
   * List the available cameras using the command `VBoxManage list webcams`
      ** The available webcams should be listed using "_.x webcamName_"
   * Next run the command `VBoxManage controlvm "<yourVirtualMachineName>" webcam attach <.x>`
